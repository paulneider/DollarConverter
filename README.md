# DollarConverter

The solution consists of the following projects
- DollarConverterServer
- DollarConverterClient
- GprcConverterClient

The GprcConverterClient is a helper project to generate the gRPC types for the DollarConverterClient-project. This is a documented [issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/aspnet/core/grpc/troubleshoot?view=aspnetcore-7.0#wpf-projects-unable-to-generate-grpc-c-assets-from-proto-files) for the use of gRPC in WPF-projects and it is the recommended workaround.
